This file contains all the broken/planned things to do within
The GNU Netcat project.

If you wish to contribute about one of these points, feel free
to mail me if you need any further information.



    TODO/bugs in Netcat
==================================

 o Write the README file!

 o I need to study deeply the -g/-G options issue in order to make
   them working properly.

 o I need to fetch information about the history of this tool,
   so I can give credits to the right people for the design and
   the original code.

 o The configure script must properly check res_init() by including
   the <resolv.h> file.

 o Netcat should be ported on Win32 too, but I haven't Win32 coding
   experience unfortunately.  Anyone is willing to help?

 o I think that two netcats with the `-T' (telnet) option enabled
   may enter an infinite loop because of the weak telnet protocol
   implementation. Check this and fix.

 o Currently the telnet codes parsing function overrides the
   send queue for the remote socket if it has to reply to some
   telnet codes found in the incoming data.  Check what the RFC
   says about this, since with the `-i' option this could be
   a very important difference.

 o The following execution of Netcat causes an assertion to trigger:
      sh1~$ cat bigfile | netcat -l -p <some port>
      sh2~$ netcat localhost <listening port>
   This can be caused by a listening daemon that sends some data and
   then closes the connection immediately.

 o In core_udp_listen() there is a socket duplication that may cause
   data loss in the receive queue.  Remove that code and solve that
   issue in some other way.



    Future features/Planning
==================================

 o Add IPv6 support

    o This should be controlled by a command line switch like
      `-6' and `-4'.

    o Netcat should also be able to tunnel ipv6/ipv4 in tunnel
      mode

 o Add command line switch -X, --input-hexdump so that read from
   stdin some valid hexdump-style data, and accepts it in some
   standard forms (more than one)

 o I'd like to add support for the OpenSSL library. I will first
   need to solve license issues and then the implementation
   issues.
