Netcat was created in the year 1995 and was developed until first months of
the 1996, when it reached version 1.10, released by Avian Research (avian.org).

The credits for the original design and alpha source code goes to the Avian
Research team, while this development branch (called "GNU Netcat") was started
by Giovanni Giacobbi <giovanni@giacobbi.net>, to improve portability, usability
and features design.
