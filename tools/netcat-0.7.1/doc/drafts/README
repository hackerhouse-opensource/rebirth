   Advanced Sockets API for IPv6

   This RFC explains various sockets APIs for both IPv6 and IPv4.  Netcat in particular
   uses the IN_PKTINFO extension for IPv4 in order to know which interface received an
   UDP packet, when bound to INADDR_ANY.
   Only a few OSes have this extension (read only Linux), so the other solution is to
   create a listening UDP socket for each possible interface.
