[*] Sun Jan 11 2004 - netcat v0.7.1

  o Fixed bug in UDP connection code, using pktinfo support. [BUG #796765]
  o Fixed a segfault in the DNS lookup routines, caused by invalid DNS
    configurations.
  o Fixed two compilation issues on SCO Unix 3.2 v 5.0.4. [BUG #857650],
    [BUG #857657]
  o Fixed bug in command line switch `-i' on non-linux OS such as Solaris.
    [BUG #864780]
  o The debugging support now works on libc's that don't allow NULL pointers
    passed for string (`%s') modifiers.


[*] Thu Aug 21 2003 - netcat v0.7.0

  o Added command line switch `-c' (close), which shuts down the connection
    on EOF from stdin without waiting for any answer from remote host.
  o Some previously optionally included code related to signal handling is now
    included in the default compilation.
  o Now the SIGUSR1 signal is handled and prints the current sending/receiving
    statistics to stderr, disregarding the verbosity level given.
  o Added some development sheets for those that may want to study GNU Netcat's
    development, in the doc/drafts directory.
  o Fixed a bug in UDP listening mode without pktinfo support and specifying
    the listening interface with `-s'.
  o Now when connecting to an host by an alias of its, it won't write a warning
    anymore but instead it will show the real name of the host.
  o Various fixes for code portability.  Changed the debugging support routines,
    and checking better what kind of compiler there is. [BUG #677625]
  o Fixed a simple compile error on Solaris7. [BUG #788870]
  o Fixed core dump in command line parsing routines when fgets() returned an
    empty string. [BUG #791799]
  o Now netcat is able to handle large amount of data, without overflowing the
    socket queues anymore.


[*] Tue Oct 15 2002 - netcat v0.6.1

  o Fixed a compilation error in the "doc/" subdirectory when using virtual
    paths.
  o Fixed the socket creation function not setting the right sockopts.  This
    caused netcat to fail opening sockets in some situations.
  o Unified the SIOCGIF* and SIOCGLIF* extension in order to allow udphelper
    compile on Solaris.
  o Fixed a compilation error in udphelper.c on Solaris.
  o Added type "in_port_t" to indicate port numbers in network byte order.
    Also the "nc_port_t" object now contains the port number both in host byte
    order and network byte order notation, which needs less conversions.
  o Added slovak translation, thanks to Lubomir Sedlacik.


[*] Thu Aug 22 2002 - netcat v0.6.0

  o Rewritten the udp listening routines.  Now it uses the newly added
    udphelper routines in order to allow a portable way to simulate two-ends
    connections in UDP mode.
  o Added the NEWS file containing release notes since version 0.2.1.
  o Fixes and additions to the configure script.
  o Now compiles even if random support is not present in the OS.
  o Fixed `-V' option not working. [BUG #588761]
  o Fixed a compilation (a missing header) error on some older BSD4 machines.
  o Fixed hexdump of incoming data that was showing the wrong memory section.
    This bug was introduced with the queues model in core.c.
  o Now it is possible to disable the debugging support at runtime if it was
    compiled in.
  o Restored the command line switch `-e' (exec).
  o Added new beta signal handling functions.
  o Fixed connection failures not handled properly in tunnel mode.
  o Fixed global return status to match the program specifications.
  o Sockets shouldn't be left in a TIME_WAIT status anymore. [BUG #588961]
  o Updated internal gettext support to version 0.11.5.
  o The hexdump function now doesn't buffer more than one data block anymore.
    This caused some packets not to be logged if Netcat dead unexpectedly.
  o Fixed compiling/linking error on some BSD machines with external intl
    library.
  o Included significant rfcs in the distribution package.


[*] Tue Jun 18 2002 - netcat v0.5.2

  o Fixed a bug in UDP listen mode with unspecified port where Netcat was not
    actually listening.
  o Now a verbosity level 2 message is printed on listening.
  o Made netcat_strid() public in network.c with some minor changes.
  o More code cleanup.  Added a global variable netcat_mode to specify in which
    mode netcat was launched.
  o Fixed a preprocessor warning on some OSes.
  o Many fixes to the resolver functions.  Now all weird DNS things that you
    may find in the net are reported with the `-v' command line switch.
  o Fixed a bug with some redirected input stream where it didn't check other
    streams for new data anymore.
  o Error messages on connect failure (both in connecting mode and tunneling
    mode) were totally wrong.
  o Statistics now use a human readable output and are printed even in the
    listen mode and tunnel mode. [BUG #569618]
  o Minor fixes on the errors output.
  o More updates to the documentation.


[*] Mon Jun 10 2002 - netcat v0.5.1

  o Completely rewritten the function core_readwrite() in order to allow more
    possibilities of features adding.
  o Minor code cleanup.
  o Fixed a variable not correctly initialized, causing netcat to bind() with
    bogus information in certain circumstances.
  o Changed the prototype of the telnet codes parsing function to match the
    new objects-based design.
  o With udp listening mode the first 1024 bytes of the first incoming packet
    are no longer lost.
  o More updates to the man and info documentation files.
  o Now compiles correctly on Solaris (there was some configure checks
    missing).
  o Fixed a make error in the doc/ subdirectory.


[*] Fri May 31 2002 - netcat v0.5.0

  o Fixed the udp mode listen, which didn't allow any kind of safe read from
    stdin.
  o Generalized flagset.c to be more a library file.  Fixed some minor bugs in
    the interface.
  o Fixed a bug in ncprint() which didn't respect the EXIT flag if the
    verbosity flag was also specified and not satisfied.
  o Rewritten the core routines and arguments handling to allow a better
    features support.
  o Fixed several mis-behaviours for UDP protocol.
  o Cleaned up the global namespace
  o Now the -x option hexdumps also the source ip address in the introducing
    message.
  o Changed all the netcat defined types names.
  o Restored the tunnel mode functionality.  Now it is even able to tunnel from
    tcp to udp and vice-versa.
  o The udp listening mode now recognizes the `-z' command line switch.
  o Changed telnet command line switch from `-t' to `-T', added the change
    notify to doc/migration.
  o Fixed a design bug in the UDP protocol in listen mode.  The connection
    should be created with the exact interface as identified by the incoming
    packet.  Unfortunately this fix applies only on Linux because it's the
    only OS that supports RFC 2292 extensions to IPv4.
  o Updated the man and info documentation files.


[*] Wed May 15 2002 - netcat v0.4.0

  o Now netcat_socket_accept() recognizes a negative timeout parameter.
  o Splitted core functions like readwrite() to core.c, this allows a more
    modular programming and allows a better features-implementation.
  o Moved some low level code from main.c to core.c
  o Added UDP protocol support, but it is a little buggy still, because I have
    got some logistic problems to solve before fixing the implementation.
  o Fixed various socket leaks.
  o Reimplemented command line switch `-z' for TCP protocol.
  o Handled the listen mode-zero I/O case situation.
  o Port ranges now are recognized even in the form min:max
  o Fixed a bug in core_tcp_connect(), which didn't handle properly socket
    connection failures on very fast hosts (such as localhost).
  o Rewritten telnet support.  Now we have a more reliable implementation of
    the RFC0854.  Netcat will also rewrite the incoming buffer with the telnet
    codes stripped.
  o Updated doc/migration with new incompatibilities found.
  o Added configure option `--enable-oldtelnet', which restores the old nc110
    telnet codes parsing policy.
  o Added configure option `--enable-compat', which turnes on ALL the other
    backwards compatibility switches.
  o Cleanup of the main header file and to the global environment.
  o First beta release!


[*] Thu May  9 2002 - netcat v0.3.1

  o Now "make install" also symlinks "nc" to the program file "netcat".
  o More careful use of stderr/stdout for printing messages
  o Updated file doc/migration
  o Now it is possible to force the local source port when connecting to
    somewhere using the -p option (this is not yet possible in tunnel mode).
  o Fixed some output messages in netcat.c


[*] Mon May  6 2002 - netcat v0.3.0

  o Fixed netcat_resolvehost() to be more library function.
  o Added function netcat_socket_new() to network.c
  o Added functions netcat_socket_new_listen() and netcat_socket_accept()
    to network.c
  o configure now checks for important gettext external data.
  o Updated files INSTALL and COPYING
  o Added function netcat_inet_ntop() to network.c
  o Fixed backwards incompatibility in netcat_fhexdump()
  o Added file doc/migration.
  o Fully rewrote the core part of the project.  The new core has total async
    I/O support and is totally select() based.  It also introduces a new
    command line arguments parsing style.  See the doc/migration file for more
    information.
  o Fixed the delayed (-i) output sending not displaying incoming data
    immediately.
  o Verbose messages are now printed automatically in debug mode.
  o Changed copyrighter name
  o Added command line switch `-L', activates the tunnel mode to the host and
    port specified on the command line.
  o Added function netcat_inet_pton() to network.c
  o Added function ncprint() to misc.c, this allows a more powerful output
    management and a more readability of the source code.
  o Lots of fixes and improvements for portability


[*] Wed May  1 2002 - netcat v0.2.2

  o More fixes around the NLS (added the missing config.rpath script)
  o Added lib directory that will contain all netcat related libraries.
  o Added compatibility support (libcontrib) containing all the needed
    functions not provided by the OS.
  o Added GNU getopt to the compat library.
  o More changes to the netcat_getport() function. Now it should catch every
    kind of invalid input safely.


[*] Tue Apr 30 2002 - netcat v0.2.1

  o Various fixes to the Makefiles for the clean targets
  o Fixed --enable-debug configure parameter
  o Added configure option `--enable-oldhexdump', causes netcat to use the
    old hexdump style rather than my new style.
  o Added macros debug_d and debug_dv, respectively debug plus delay and
    debug verbose plus delay.  Removed the old Debug macro.
  o Restored command line switch `-w' (wait).
  o Rewrote (again) netcat_resolvehost(), this time it's a little more
    abstracted.
  o Removed libtool support (it wasn't really needed at the moment)
  o Added Native Language Support to the project
  o Added the first traslation file (italian)


[*] Mon Apr 29 2002 - netcat v0.2.0

  o Changed the define HINF to typedef netcat_host.
  o Removed comparehosts() function.
  o Removed gethostpoop() function.
  o Fixed some warnings.
  o Added file network.c, containing function netcat_resolvehost(), which is
    the equivalent of the old gethostpoop().
  o Added debug() and debug_v() routines, to improve debugging output.
    Debug() is now obsolete and will be removed soon.
  o Added file proto.h, containing all externs and function declarations.
  o Changed some global variable names and types
  o Added function netcat_fhexdump() which substitutes the old oprint()
    function.  Removed some unused global variables.
  o Added command line switch `-x' (hexdump). Switch `-o' implies `-x'.
  o Added command line switch `-V' (version).
  o Added function netcat_getport() which substitutes the old getportpoop().
    Updated references to the function and related struct.


[*] Sun Apr 28 2002 - netcat v0.1.0

  o Great cleanup of the original source files, this will be the base for the
    rewrite.
  o Rewrote command line reader from stdin (dynamically rebuilds argv based on
    the input string.
  o Added functions netcat_string_split() and netcat_commandline().
