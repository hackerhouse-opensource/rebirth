Type "make" on OS-X to build a C source code with "arm64" architecture supported binary that is then 
"self-signed" using jtool. This adds basic entitlements so you can then run your C code inside the 
iOS device from the command shell. This is a sample project to be used for building tools into 
rebirth.
